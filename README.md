Gen AI

a chatbot involves several steps and components. You would need to integrate LinkedIn's API, set up a server to monitor profile views, and implement a notification system. Here is an outline of the steps and an example code snippet to get you started.

Steps to Create the Chatbot:
Set Up LinkedIn API:

Register your application on LinkedIn Developer Portal.
Obtain Client ID and Client Secret.
Request access tokens to interact with LinkedIn API.
Monitor Profile Views:

Use LinkedIn API to monitor profile views.
Filter views by top industry persons for GenAI roles from MAANG companies.
Notification System:

Set up a server to handle notifications.
Integrate a messaging service (like Twilio, Slack, or email service) to send notifications.
Code Implementation:

The example below demonstrates how to set up a basic server to monitor LinkedIn profile views and send notifications.
Example Code Snippet:
1. LinkedIn API Integration
Python
import requests

def get_linkedin_profile_views(access_token):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
    }
    response = requests.get("https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me", headers=headers)
    return response.json()

def filter_views(views):
    maang_companies = ["Meta", "Apple", "Amazon", "Netflix", "Google"]
    filtered_views = [view for view in views if view['company'] in maang_companies and 'GenAI' in view['role']]
    return filtered_views
 1 vulnerability detected
2. Notification System
Python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_notification(to_email, subject, message):
    from_email = "your-email@example.com"
    msg = MIMEText(message)
    msg["Subject"] = subject
    msg["From"] = from_email
    msg["To"] = to_email

    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.example.com", 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(from_email, "your-email-password")
        server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, msg.as_string())
3. Server Implementation
Python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/notify', methods=['POST'])
def notify():
    data = request.json
    views = get_linkedin_profile_views(data['access_token'])
    filtered_views = filter_views(views)
    
    if filtered_views:
        for view in filtered_views:
            message = f"Your LinkedIn profile was viewed by {view['name']} from {view['company']} for a GenAI role. LinkedIn ID: {view['linkedin_id']}, Email: {view['email']}"
            send_email_notification(data['email'], "LinkedIn Profile View Notification", message)
    
    return jsonify({"status": "Notification sent"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
Notes:
LinkedIn API: LinkedIn's API usage is restricted, and certain data might not be accessible with a free version.
Security: Ensure that you handle tokens and sensitive data securely.
Server: The example uses Flask for simplicity. You can deploy this on any cloud service provider.
For detailed information, you should refer to LinkedIn's API documentation: LinkedIn API Documentation

This example is a starting point. You will need to adapt and expand it to cover all use cases and handle errors.
